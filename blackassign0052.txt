“data    oil”     important trendline   21st century. the reason     advancements   fields related  data analysis. the field   machine learning statistics  data mining  deal  data   developing    staggering pace,   fields     popular buzzwords  days.buzzwords  originated  technical terms    underlying essence    fashionable      impress. this   main reason   misconception  people. , ml, stats, data mining,    fields related   analysis  data    mistook      thing,    words    interchangeably  convey     thing. but    true  !the  similarity   disciplines      disciplines  related   analysis   data  converting  data  “information”.in academics,  learning  machine learning statistics  data mining,  academic approach  wander   technical definitions  concepts   underlying essence   aim   discipline remain unexplored,    case     articles      explain  difference. thus,   primary   confusion  learners. hence,  article explains  difference  explaining  philosophy   aims     disciplines   wandering   technical definitions.then    difference   machine learning statistics  data mining?the essential difference   disciplines lies   “aims”   approach   achieve  aims.the aims     fieldsare explained  detail    sections:artificial intelligence:the aim  artificial intelligence   understand intelligent entities. then  satisfy  aim,    understand   intelligence   makes  agent intelligent agent? the answer    questions   found  studying intelligent agents       intelligent agent   found   standing  front   mirror! yes! humans    examples  intelligent entities. thus,   1900s, researchers began exploring  thought process,  reasoning process  humans  human beings  considered   ideal intelligent agent. mimicking human behavior   aim     initial years   research. after setting  goal, studies  experiments began    famous experiment conducted   initial years  achieve  aim   turing test! turing defined intelligent behavior   ability  achieve human-level performance   cognitive tasks, sufficient  fool  interrogator. but  test received criticism   mimicking human behavior    intelligence. because intelligence   related   working   human brain    human brain, intelligence   meaning! thus, mimicking human thought processes  reasoning   transformed aim. the field  psychology  philosophy  resonate   aim    understand  human thought process. the difference        understand  thought process   mimic , build . the collaboration   fields resulted  models   neural networks    mimic  function  neurons present   human brain. so, basically,  initial aim  human-centered  humans  considered   ideal intelligent agent.concurrently,  field  computer science  developing   greater pace. with  advances  computer science,  experiments  theories   easily tested  validated. as programs   applied  solve real-life problems,   found  computers performed   humans   tasks    complex  humans. one    examples      chess-playing program. an  program defeated  world’  chess player garry kasparov. this incident   human intelligence    ultimate intelligence    human      defeat   program. this leads   question,  human intelligence  ideal intelligence?as computers   advanced,  proved     humans   complex tasks. that     definition  intelligence   related   ability  solve cognitive tasks  problems. so,     nature  agents, researchers began  study  nature  intelligence . then  question    test  validate intelligence? the    test intelligence   solve cognitive problems. an agent    intelligent     solve  complex problem. the problem-solving approach   easily tested  validated  computers. thus,  researchers began studying  ideal intelligence,   selected agent  validate  experiments   computer. so,  computer  problem-solving approach  adopted. so,  human-centered approach  computer, problem-solving approach    main aims  . both   fields  contributed   field  giving valuable insights.both  aims  important     collaboratively form  main aim  !machine learning:in  problem-solving approach,    big challenge     overcome  order  achieve  aim. consider    solving  math problem. there   cases   intelligence   tested   problem-solving approach. let    math problems      solve. the  problem  familiar      problem  .consider   problem. the  problem  familiar  ,  means     solve  kind  problems     solved  similar problems   past. so,    question,   mind    solve  problem? the answer ,    solved similar problems   past,    learned   past data,   solve  problems,     haven’   problem   past,       solve similar problems. this   form  intelligence.consider  case       problem     solved  kind  problems   past. then  solve  problem,     consciously gather  manipulate   information    reach   conclusion. this kind  approach   necessarily rely   past data  completely   reasoning process. this    kind  intelligence.for   build intelligent agents,    kinds  intelligence   developed   agent. but,  reality     reached  point      build agents    learn  past data  find   information.  today   reached  point    build agents      . that    type  intelligence.so,       implement   type  intelligence   machine learning! so,  domain    focuses solely  implementing   kind  intelligence   fact machine learning. that   reason  ml  called  subset  ! so,    main difference    ml.technically speaking, “it   field  study   computers  ability  learn  past data  find  meaningful conclusions, patterns   explicitly programmed”. this statement   elaboration. the essence  ml  related   process  “generalization”  learning  past data. generalization   abstraction   common properties  specific instances  formulated  general concepts  claims. consider   humans recognize daily life objects. if    animal,    easily recognize     “dog”   “cat”. it    trivial task       wondered   mind     ? the answer  generalization!if     picture   dog,   easily recognize     picture   dog, ,  minds  abstracted  description   dog  formulated    “concept”    dog    concepts       learned   past experiences   dog. so,      dependent   fact  things  represented  generalized concepts   minds.with generalization ,   real “information”. so,    give computers  ability  generalize  “raw data”  convert   “information”    patterns  trends   data   .statistics:this   discipline  concerns  collection, organization, analysis, interpretation,  presentation  data. statistics   deal  data    aim    explain . so,    study  explaining  data ! statistics   main domains   descriptive statistics  inferential statistics.descriptive statistics deals   explanation  description  data    “descriptive” statistics. it   explain   information  , easily    large data      complex task .inferential statistics   make accurate inferences    small data. we  inference   tasks   daily lives. consider  simple case  cooking  soup. after completing  recipe,   taste  small sample,  ,  spoonful   soup  check   soup tastes good  bad. depending   result   sample,  make  inference    soup    soup   , good  bad. similarly,  statistics,   cases     apply inference   meaningful information. for ,   case    gather   data     time-consuming  costly. in  cases, applying inference based    sample introduces uncertainty. that   inferential statistics   .so,   data   context  uncertainty  decision-making   face  uncertainty   statistics deals . so, ,    data, statistics   explain  data. this aim   resonate      ml,  statistics   fields  correctly interpret  data!data mining: “data”,        raw form. consider examples  sensors   industrial applications. these sensors      manufacturing plant  sense  properties  temperature, pressure, . the raw data generated   sensors         converted   suitable form,  processed, analyzed  gather valuable insights,      solve  problem!due   unique aim  capturing  essence   large datasets,  gather insights, data mining   referred   “knowledge discovery”. that  , carly fiorina,  ceo  hewlett-packard  , “the goal   turn data  information  information  insight”. this statement completely explains  aim  data mining! so,  difference   machine learning statistics  data mining lies   aims. but  approaches      fields,         fulfilling  aims    fields. this   beauty   fields!blackcoffer insights 25: abhishek govekar, vishwakarma institute  technology, pune, india.
